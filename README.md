# **Analysis of personal expenses**

Analysis of my personal expenses while on a long-term trip.

## **1. Motivation**

In this project, I want to analyze my personal expenses during a long-term trip to Thailand.

A bit about myself: For the last 6 years I worked as a technical product manager for a small company in Bavaria, Germany. I decided to leave my job and look for a new occupation, but before that I wanted to travel a bit.

While traveling, I took several online courses on Coursera on data analytics, which piqued my interest in the field. Now I'm continuing to learn.
This is my first project using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## **2. Action plan**

### **2.1 Data source**

The data comes from an expense tracker app on my smartphone, in which I make entries every time I have expenses.
The app gives me the ability to export the data in CSV format, which does things easy to get the data into pandas DataFrame.

### **2.2 Used tools and progress (ticked = done)**

- [x] **Python** (**mainly pandas**) clean and transform the data
- [x] **SQLite** store the cleaned data
- [ ] **Python** explore and visualize the data using Altair package
